# Manzoom - A Literary Management System

## Overview
Manzoom is a **Literary Management System** inspired by Rekhta, developed in **C++**, and designed to combine the beauty of literature with the efficiency of technology. It enables users to explore, manage, and contribute to a collection of Urdu poetry while providing role-based access for Readers, Poets, and Administrators.

## Features
### 1. Normal User

- **Search and Navigation**: Easily search for poets, poetry, and favorite verses.
- **Profile Management**: Update your name and credentials effortlessly.

### 2. Poet
- **Poetry Submission**: Submit your work to the system for review and approval.
- **Role-Specific Access**: Focus on contributions without viewing approval counts.

### 3. Administrator (Hidden)
- **Predefined Account**: Access the admin role by entering `10` in the main menu and using the password `1`.
- **Manage Users and Submissions**: Oversee system operations, approve poetry, and handle data integrity.
